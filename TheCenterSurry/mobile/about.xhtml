	<br /><b>For the Community</b>
	<br />The Center was started to help the community in any way possible. We now offer free internet use, warm and comfortable space and friendship, and other various events to help meet the needs of our town.
	<br />
	<br /><b>Drinks and Snacks</b>
	<br />We offer a variety of drinks and snacks for sale at the Center. Check out our <a href="menu.xhtml">menu</a> for a complete list.	
	<br />
	<br /><b>Drinks and Snacks</b>
	<br />The Center offers free wi-fi internet access. We also have several computers available to use free of charge. (We ask that guests observe a 30 minute time limit when others are waiting to use the computers.) <b>Printing solutions are also available</b> for 25&#162; per page black and white and 50&#162; per page color.

	<br />As residents of Surry we face numerous challenges in our community. Young people are in need of positive activities and strong role models. Many people are struggling with financial problems, relationship issues, and loneliness. Divisions of race and background fragment our community. That is why we are here, and that is why we are busy...

	<br />
	<br />These are the qualities that we aspire to portray as we serve others. They are the things that are important to us.
	<br />
	<br /><b>Sharing Life</b>
	<br />We live life together. We work together. We learn together. We play together. We serve together. We share our hard times and our triumphs knowing that life is better together than alone.
	<br />
	<br /><b>Service</b>
	<br />We are always ready to give to others, to help others, to point them in the right direction
	<br />
	<br /><b>Simplicity</b>
	<br />We choose to live life simply. We value people over things, comfort, and entertainment. We commit our time, our finances, and our energy to being people who love people and never people who love things.
	<br />
	<br /><b>Sincerity</b>
	<br />We live with honesty and transparency. We will always be real with people. We will be open about our needs and challenges in life and not cover ourselves with insincerity, tradition, or habit.
	<br />
	<br /><b>Selflessness</b>
	<br />We will give ourselves other. We will always treat others the way we want to be treated. We will put others first
