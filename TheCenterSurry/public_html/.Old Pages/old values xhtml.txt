									<p>We are always ready to give to others, to help others, to point them in the right direction</p>

									<p><b>Simplicity</b></p>
									<p>We choose to live life simply. We value people over things, comfort, and entertainment. We commit our time, our finances, and our energy to being people who love people and never people who love things. </p>

									<p><b>Sincerity</b></p>
									<p>We live with honesty and transparency. We will always be real with people. We will be open about our needs and challenges in life and not cover ourselves with insincerity, tradition, or habit. </p>
